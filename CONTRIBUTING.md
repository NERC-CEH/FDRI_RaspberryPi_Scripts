We welcome contributions to this project, either from members of the Floods and Droughts Research Infrastructure project or from the wider world!

* Whether your proposed change or fix really belongs here, or rather in one of the projects that we re-use and depend on
* Whether you are able to release your proposed changes under the GPL 3.0 Licence

Please contact one of the project owners (currently @metazool and @ffgerard) if you have any questions.
